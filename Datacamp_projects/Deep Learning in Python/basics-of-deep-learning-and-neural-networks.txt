Calculate the value in node 0 by multiplying input_data by its weights weights['node_0'] and computing their sum. This is the 1st node in the hidden layer.
Calculate the value in node 1 using input_data and weights['node_1']. This is the 2nd node in the hidden layer.
Put the hidden layer values into an array. This has been done for you.
Generate the prediction by multiplying hidden_layer_outputs by weights['output'] and computing their sum











# Calculate node 0 value: node_0_value
node_0_value = (input_data * weights['node_0']).sum()

# Calculate node 1 value: node_1_value
node_1_value = (input_data * weights['node_1']).sum()
# Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_value, node_1_value])

# Calculate output: output
output = (hidden_layer_outputs * weights['output']).sum()

# Print output
print(output)
